# .gitignoreは絶賛整備中のため実行ファイルや実行結果ファイルをコミットしないこと

# yogaya-cli

> ⚠️ WARNING: .gitignore is currently under development. Do not commit executable files or execution result files.

## Installation

First, install Go using Homebrew (Mac):

```bash
brew install go
```

> Go has backward version compatibility, so having the latest version installed will allow you to run older code and executables.

Verify the installation:

```bash
go version
```

> If the version is displayed, the installation is complete.

## Package Installation

Before building, install required packages:

```bash
go mod tidy
```

> This command will automatically download and install all necessary dependencies defined in the project.

## Build Instructions

1. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd ./yogaya-cli
    ```

2. Build the project:
   ```bash
   go build -o yogaya ./main.go
    ```

> This will generate an executable file (yogaya) in the repository.
>
> Command structure:
> `go build -o <executable_name> <build_target>`
>
> While it might seem like the build target should specify the entire project,
> specifying just main.go is sufficient for building.
>
> To change the executable name, modify the 'yogaya' argument in the command.

## Running the Built Executable

You can run the executable in two ways:

- Create .yogaya directory in current directory:
   ````bash
   ./yogaya init ./
    ````

- Create .yogaya directory in home directory:
   ```bash
   ./yogaya init
    ```

The .yogaya directory will contain:
- `cloud_accounts.conf`: Empty file
- `tenant.conf`: Contains tenant key in format `tenant_key=<current local time converted to hexadecimal>`
- `.git`: Directory generated by the "git init" command

## Generated Directory Structure

```
.yogaya/
├── cloud_accounts.conf (empty file)
├── tenant.conf (contains tenant key)
└── .git/ (git initialization directory)
```
